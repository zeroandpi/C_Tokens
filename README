# This repo. contents 2 files: tokens.c and camelCase.c

# 1. Compiled tokens.c, for example
	
	clang tokens.c
	# Or
	gcc tokens.c

	# Run the a.out file
	./a.out

# 2. Compiled camelCase.c (same above), you probably see the error (may be like this belove)

	camelCase.c:19:11: error: expected identifier or '('
        int auto = 4; // Since auto is a keyword -> crash program. NOTE: remove or comment this line -> OK
                 ^
	1 error generated.

	# Fix the error by remove or comment the line ( int auto = 4; ... ).
	# Of course you can change (auto) to another name (e.g. four), it works too.

	# Recompiled camelCase.c
